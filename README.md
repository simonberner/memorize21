# Memorize 2021

This is a work in progress learning project for my personal endeavours of becoming an iOS Developer one day.
Memorize is a [Memory Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_game) and runs on iOS and iPadOS (version >=14). Its purpose is to practice the MVVM paradigm, Swift and SwiftUI.

## Tech Stack
- Xcode 12.5.1
- Swift 5.4
- SwiftUI 

## Learnings
### MVVM
- The View is completely decoupled from the Model
- The View is reactive and always reflects the current state of the model
- The ViewModel interpretates the Model for the View
### Gradient
- [SwiftUI has a built-in way to apply gradient color](https://sarunw.com/posts/gradient-in-swiftui/)
